DESCRIPTION
===========

The tests included here are no unit tests but test that the OS abstraction
layer works for all supported plattforms. To run the programs the 
corresponding boards are needed.

The `reference` folder contains a reference implementation which must be
useable by all OS without any changes. Additional OS/HW specific set-up
functions are added in the corresponding folders.
