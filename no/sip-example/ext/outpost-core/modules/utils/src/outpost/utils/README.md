The utils module is split into the following subject areas:

# Coding

Coding contains algorithms to en- and decode data. E.g. the CRC algorithms
are located here.

# Container

Adds specialized container classes for embedded systems. These include
fixed size or bounded arrays/lists or intrusive data structures.

# Storage

The classes in storage deal with the bit/byte representation of objects. This
includes the serialization framework, as well as the bit access classes.
